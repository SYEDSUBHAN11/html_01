    <h1>Understanding Nested Links in Web Development</h1>

    <p>
      In my web development course, I have been learning how to effectively link
      pages using HTML. One of the key concepts I’ve explored is the creation of
      nested links, which allows for a structured navigation system within a
      website.
    </p>

    <h2>Navigating the File Structure</h2>

    <p>
      By utilizing relative paths, I can access various files within a nested
      directory structure. Here’s a brief overview of how to navigate through
      parent, grandparent, child, and grandchild files:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Parent File</strong>: This is the immediate directory that
        contains the current file. To link to a parent file, I use the
        <code>../</code> syntax, which moves up one level in the directory
        hierarchy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Grandparent File</strong>: To access a grandparent file, I can
        use <code>../../</code>, which moves up two levels in the directory
        structure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Child File</strong>: Linking to a child file is straightforward;
        I simply reference the file name directly if it resides in the same
        directory.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Grandchild File</strong>: To link to a grandchild file, I
        specify the path from the parent file, including the child directory and
        the grandchild file name.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      By mastering these linking techniques, I am building a solid foundation
      for creating well-organized and easily navigable websites. This knowledge
      is essential for developing user-friendly web applications and enhancing
      the overall user experience.
